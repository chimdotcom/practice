        <h2>About mee!</h2>
        <p>I'm a 2nd year student of Computer Engineering studying at AfeBabalola University, Ado-Ekiti. Going to be in my 3rd year this October!!</p>
        <p>I'm 17 currently. Born on the 10<sup>th</sup> of October. I enjoy watching films so much! I love cinematography and being able to watch other people's stories, whether fictional or non-fictional.</p>
        <p>Just started learning how to code. Still on HTML though and it's not very pretty(visually). Can't wait to get into CSS and JavaScript to really get to design this.</p>
        <p> That's all for now. Byee!</p>
